# odin-shopping-cart Planning

## Spec

- At least two pages with persistent navigation bar
  - Home page
    - Images and basic layout
  - Shop page
    - Navigation bar displays number of items in cart with button to checkout and pay (inactive button)
    - Card elements for products
      - Product title
      - Input field for number of items to buy
      - Increment "+" and Decrement "-" button to fine-tune number of items
      - "Add to Cart" button
    - Shop items are fetched from [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
    - After order submitted, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly

Additionally:

- No props validation errors - use PropTypes
- Test using React Testing Library
  - Don't test `react-router-dom` directly
- Style application using CSS Modules
- Deploy to Netlify

## My implementation

The description of the Shopping Cart being in the Navbar is confusing me - typically Shopping Cart icons are in the Navbar but the cart itself will be a modal or its own distinct page (the total cost and list of items won't be in the Navbar). The Amazon website has a vertical column that appears once the shopping cart has an item in it, listing the subtotal, item, quantity, remove button. Also a button to go to the cart as its own page.

```txt
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|     NAVBAR                            1 Basket->|Subtotal|
|-------------------------------------------------|        |
|                                                 | ... ...|
|     SHOP                                        |        |
```

The Cart column has:

```txt
Subtotal
$XXX.XX

+----------+
|Go to cart|
+----------+

------------
[ITEM IMAGE]

$XXX.XX

+----+
|1 V |        (Down arrow next to the number, clicking opens up a simple quantity selector)
+----+

 ðŸ—‘
------------
[ITEM IMAGE]

...etc
```

So I think I will do this as a grid with Navbar, Shop and Cart, where Cart only shows if it has items in it.

```txt
+---------------------------------------------------+-------+
|           NAVBAR                                  | CART  |
+---------------------------------------------------|       |
|           SHOP                                    |       |
|                                                   |       |
| ITEM      ITEM      ITEM      ITEM                |       |
|                                                   |       |
|                                                   |       |
```
